Hello!

Thanks for visiting my blog, I guess that if you are here right now is because you want to know a little bit more about me so let me introduce myself...

My name is Jaume Capdevila and I'm a passionate software developer, gamer and dogs lover from Barcelona. I studied my degree in La Salle University, where currently I spent some time teaching about Web Development. In my day to day, I enjoy myself working as Software Engineer at Magento.

I like to spend my free time playing video games, watching TV shows and movies, traveling as much as I can and reading about pretty much anything. I'm also an enthusiast of the technology and the photography.

I hope you are now more familiar with me. If you any news to share or a cool project to start working on, go and [ping me](mailto:jaumecapdevila.net?Subject=Ping).
