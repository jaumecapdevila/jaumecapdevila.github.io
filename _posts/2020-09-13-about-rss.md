According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS), RSS is a [web feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed). You can think about it as a document, usually in the form of an XML or a JSON, used to deliver frequently updated content which you can then consume.

Most websites, papers, blogs etc deliver updates via RSS so that you do not need to constantly check about new content. To consume it, you can choose from several [online services](https://www.lifewire.com/top-free-online-rss-readers-3486649) or desktop/mobile applications.

Finally, if you like the content on my wiki and want to stay tuned, you can get subscribed to this [feed]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml).
