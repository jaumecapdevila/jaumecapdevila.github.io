# Welcome

Here we are!!! I'm so excited that I don't really know how to start. Building my personal blog it's been a task in my infinite to do list since ever, so I'm so happy to see that is finally happening. With that said, I think that I'm going to start by explaining what is this blog going to be about.

## About this blog

One of the things that I like most about my job, is the amazing community that we developers share. There are a lot of people open sourcing their projects making thinks easier for the rest of us, a lot of cool articles, books and many other resources that we have available for free that let us to upgrade our knowledge about something or just to get started with it, and of course let's not forget about all the guys that at least once in their lives, have replied to a question posted in [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or any other blog, saving the time of the developer that is probably crying alone in front of his screen (who has never been in a situation like this). So basically, what I'm trying to say is that I have received a lot about this community and that I want continue helping to contribute to it by blogging about my experiences, problems which I've been struggling with during all these years of development, maybe about cool projects that I've been playing with and many more.

### What's next

In my following post, I'm going to start by explaining how I have built this blog, the technology behind it and the resources that I have followed. Stay tuned and see you soon in the next episode!!!
