Hello, and welcome to my blog.

I'm very excited to be writing this post right now. The task of implementing this blog has been waiting in my enormous TO DO list for too long... I think a good starting point would be to talk about the main motivations behind this blog and the kind of content you can expect from it.

## But first...

I've been working as a developer for more than 5 years, and one of the things that has surprised me the most since the beginning, is the amount of resources (articles, posts, libraries...), and the cool people that you can find in this community. I can't count the number of times that a simple response in [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) has saved me a lot of time and tears, or how many things I've learned just by talking and sharing ideas with some random folks in a Meetup or an event.

With that on mind, I find it appropriate to dedicate a few lines to say thank you to all of you that have spent some time writing an article or some post, open sourcing a library or a package, talking in a coference or any other event and many, many more...

## Motivations

I've been teaching about Web Development for 2 years now, and I can say you that by doing so, I've learned a lot. When you are thinking about how are you going to explain something to someone, you will probably think about some of the possible questions that your audience can do to you. In this process, you can find out some concepts that you missed when you were learning about the topic. For this reason, one of uses that I will give this blog is to write about new things I want to learn or about some topics that I want to go deeper.

## Closing words

I hope you've enjoyed this first reflections and that I have caught your attention enough to see you in the future posts that will come very soon.
